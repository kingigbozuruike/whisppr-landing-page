# Netlify Forms Integration

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your waitlist form is now configured to use **Netlify Forms** with Next.js using the required workaround for the new Netlify adapter (v5).

## How It Works (Next.js Adapter v5)

Since Next.js pages are pre-rendered and stored in cache (not as static HTML), Netlify Forms requires a special workaround:

1. **Static HTML Detection**: `public/__forms.html` contains form structure for Netlify to detect at build time
2. **Dynamic Submission**: React form submits to the static HTML file via JavaScript
3. **Built-in Processing**: Netlify processes submissions and stores them in your dashboard

## What's Already Configured

âœ… **Static form detection file**: `public/__forms.html`
- Contains form structure for deploy-time detection
- Hidden from users (never displayed)
- Defines all form fields Netlify should accept

âœ… **React form component**:
- Custom form submission handling
- Submits to `/__forms.html` endpoint
- Client-side validation and error handling
- Success/error state management

âœ… **Form fields configured**:
- `email` - Email address field (required)
- `name` - Optional name field  
- `why` - Optional reason field
- `consent` - Required consent checkbox

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify

The form is now correctly configured for Next.js adapter v5. Just deploy your site:

```bash
# Push your changes to Git
git add .
git commit -m "Add Netlify Forms integration with Next.js adapter v5 workaround"
git push origin main

# Netlify will automatically build and deploy if connected to your Git repo
```

### 2. Verify Form Detection

After deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site
3. Check **Site settings** > **Forms**
4. You should see "waitlist" form listed

### 3. Test Submission

1. Visit your live site
2. Fill out the waitlist form
3. Submit it
4. Check **Netlify Dashboard** > **Forms** > **waitlist** for the submission

## Viewing Submissions

All form submissions will appear in:
- **Netlify Dashboard** > **Forms** > **waitlist**
- You can also set up email notifications
- Export submissions as CSV

## Notifications (Optional)

Set up email notifications for new submissions:
1. Go to **Site settings** > **Forms** > **Form notifications**
2. Add your email address
3. Choose notification triggers

## Local Development

The form automatically detects the environment:

**Development Mode (localhost):**
- Shows success message to users
- Logs submissions to browser console with "Development Mode" prefix
- Simulates network delay for realistic UX
- No actual submission to Netlify

**Production Mode (deployed site):**
- Submits to Netlify Forms via `/__forms.html`
- Stores submissions in Netlify dashboard
- Shows real success/error states

## Troubleshooting

**Form not appearing in Netlify dashboard?**
- Make sure `public/__forms.html` exists with the form structure
- Ensure the static form has `name="waitlist"` attribute
- Check that all field names match between static HTML and React form
- Redeploy your site

**Submissions not working?**
- Verify you're testing on the deployed site (not localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure form submits to `/__forms.html` endpoint
- Verify all form data is properly formatted

**Build failing with forms error?**
- This indicates the workaround is working correctly
- The static HTML file should resolve the build issue
- If still failing, check that `__forms.html` is in the `public` directory

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Ready to deploy!** Your form uses the correct Next.js adapter v5 workaround and will start collecting submissions as soon as you deploy to Netlify.

The form includes:
- âœ… Next.js adapter v5 compatibility
- âœ… Static HTML form detection (`__forms.html`)
- âœ… Dynamic form submission handling
- âœ… Email validation
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Success/error states
