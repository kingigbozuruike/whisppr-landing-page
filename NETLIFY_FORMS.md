# Netlify Forms Integration

## âœ… Setup Complete!

Your waitlist form is now configured to use **Netlify Forms** - the simplest form handling solution for static sites.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: Netlify automatically detects forms with `data-netlify="true"`
2. **Zero Configuration**: No API keys, webhooks, or external services needed
3. **Built-in Spam Protection**: Includes honeypot field for bot protection
4. **Dashboard Access**: View submissions in your Netlify dashboard

## What's Already Configured

âœ… **Form attributes added**:
- `name="waitlist"` - Form identifier
- `method="POST"` - HTTP method
- `data-netlify="true"` - Enables Netlify form processing
- `netlify-honeypot="bot-field"` - Spam protection

âœ… **Field names added**:
- `name="email"` - Email address field
- `name="name"` - Optional name field  
- `name="why"` - Optional reason field
- `name="consent"` - Required consent checkbox

âœ… **Hidden fields for Netlify**:
- `<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="waitlist" />`
- `<input type="hidden" name="bot-field" />` (honeypot)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy to Netlify

Since you already have the form configured, just deploy your site:

```bash
# Build your site
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify (drag & drop the /out folder to netlify.com)
# OR use Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```

### 2. Verify Form Detection

After deployment:
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site
3. Check **Site settings** > **Forms**
4. You should see "waitlist" form listed

### 3. Test Submission

1. Visit your live site
2. Fill out the waitlist form
3. Submit it
4. Check **Netlify Dashboard** > **Forms** > **waitlist** for the submission

## Viewing Submissions

All form submissions will appear in:
- **Netlify Dashboard** > **Forms** > **waitlist**
- You can also set up email notifications
- Export submissions as CSV

## Notifications (Optional)

Set up email notifications for new submissions:
1. Go to **Site settings** > **Forms** > **Form notifications**
2. Add your email address
3. Choose notification triggers

## Local Development

For local testing, the form will:
- Show success message to users
- Log submissions to browser console
- Not actually submit to Netlify (only works on deployed sites)

## Troubleshooting

**Form not appearing in Netlify dashboard?**
- Make sure `data-netlify="true"` is on the form
- Ensure form has `name="waitlist"` attribute
- Check that hidden `form-name` field exists
- Redeploy your site

**Submissions not working?**
- Verify you're testing on the deployed site (not localhost)
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure all form fields have `name` attributes

## Current Status

ðŸŸ¢ **Ready to deploy!** Your form will start collecting submissions as soon as you deploy to Netlify.

The form includes:
- âœ… Email validation
- âœ… Spam protection (honeypot)
- âœ… Proper error handling
- âœ… Success/error states
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Accessibility features
